              <p class="para">We travel to destinations with a story to tell, seeking hidden gems, local specialities,
                   off-the-beaten-track experiences, and jaw-dropping natural scenery to heal the soul of all its scars.
                    Weâ€™re drawn to the historical context that has shaped the lives of people and framed their collective culture. Taking each story from local to global.
                     We, at <q><strong>Prayana</strong></q>, also believe that travelling is for everyone.
                     Our goal is to build a community of independent travellers seeking to unlock richer travel experiences; 
                  helping the curious to discover less-visited places in popular destinations, and rewarding adventures in more remote locations. We are 
                waiting for you.</p>
